# LoanPrediction
"Analyzing the Relationship Between Financial Indicators and Personal Loan Acceptance"
Problem Statement:
The objective of this study is to analyze a dataset containing information on various financial metrics and customer characteristics to predict the likelihood of personal loan acceptance. The dataset includes discrete columns such as the number of customers' families, customers' education, presence of a Securities Account, CD Account, and Online services usage. Additionally, continuous features like Age, Experience, Income, CCAvg (average credit card spending), and Mortgage are provided.

Techniques Used:

Data Visualization:

Pie charts and histograms are utilized to visualize the distribution of customers across discrete features such as family size, education level, Securities Account ownership, CD Account ownership, and Online services usage.
Continuous features are visualized using histograms and KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) plots to understand their distribution and relationship with personal loan acceptance.
Interpretation of Visualizations:


Machine Learning Modeling:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression algorithms are employed for predictive modeling to classify customers into loan acceptance categories.
Cross-validation is performed to evaluate model performance and ensure robustness.
Output Description:

Results of data visualization provide insights into the distribution of customers across various categories and their association with personal loan acceptance. For example, it is observed that customers with higher income and credit card spending tend to have a higher likelihood of loan acceptance.

Machine learning models, particularly KNN, demonstrate high accuracy in predicting loan acceptance. Evaluation metrics such as confusion matrices highlight the model's ability to correctly classify customers into loan acceptance categories, minimizing false negatives and maximizing true positives.
Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing personal loan acceptance and demonstrates the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in predictive modeling for banking applications.
